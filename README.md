This adapter reads
- data from ebusd using html
In this case ebusd must run and must be able to send data to e.g. explorer via http://IP:port/data (http://192.168.0.123:8889/data)
Current version of ebusd incl. configuration files can be copied from https://github.com/john30/ebusd
All fields with data, lastup and from global section are parsed. All others are ignored at the moment. 

There is a possibillity to poll data which are not polled by ebusd directly. Command 'read -f' is used to force reading over ebus.  

Another feature is to send any command to ebusd and receive answer to work with e.g. scripts.

supported ebusd-version: 3.1

- data from ebus using a ebus interface on USB
In this case a ebus dongle (hardware interface) on USB must be available on the same system as this adapter runs.
The adapter use the same configuration files as described in case with ebusd. Advantage of this version is that you do not need to install ebusd. 
Disadvantage is that parsing of data needs power on the system, the adapter runs all the time (since ebusd version is schedelued with cron)
